# hello-world

Hi Guys!

I'm new here. I have always admired the idea of being a programmer.
I got talking with a friend who introduced me to her friend. He's such an encouraging man.
He advised me to get started with C#. I just began learning but i realise i have a lot of 
questions with nobody to ask. Lol. I got talking to a friend today who told me i could get 
all the help i need here. 
So, I'm here.
